# Security Project - KeyLogger

## Purpose
This project is for our Security class in order to better understand key loggers and potentially figure out ways we can defend against these programs.


## Goals

* Create a Key Logging Software
* Turn it into an exe that can be installed on peoples computers
* Find ways to protect against this type of software
* Format the data
* Send logging of specific inputs (credit cards, phone numbers, passwords, etc) through the internet
